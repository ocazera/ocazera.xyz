    <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>

    <p>
      By accessing or using ocazera.xyz, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.

    </p>

    <h3><span style="color:#0066FF">2.</span> No Refunds Policy</h3>
    <p>
      All sales are final. Due to the nature of digital goods and services, no refunds

      of Ocazera management. Requests must be submitted within 24 hours of purchase
      through our official Discord support server.
    </p>

    <h3><span style="color:#0066FF">3.</span> Chargeback Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Chargebacks are strictly prohibited. By purchasing from ocazera.xyz, you agree
      that filing a chargeback or payment dispute without first contacting support
      is considered fraud and theft of services.
